0.) scanDates handling for next release
---------------------------------------
In aqm.prepdata help:
protocolData(CCl4)$scanDates = rep("2006/07/19", ncol(CCl4)) # to add soon

1.) Duplicate correlation
-------------------------
If featureData contains a factor that identifies features containing 
the same reporter sequence, we can check for that (scatterplots, 
standard deviation)

2.) Outlier detection
---------------------
Use outliers package and mvoutlier package as alternatives to boxplot.stats. See flowQ as a model.




* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its dependence on draw.key). It would be better
  if it did not do that.

* With the following, why are only two arrays shown?
arrayQualityMetrics(subset10, "QA10", force = TRUE, do.logtransform = TRUE,
                    intgroup = "FactorValue..ER.status.")

* color choice of colour bars in heatmap, should be the same as for boxplots and densities.
  

* Mark outliers in density plot
