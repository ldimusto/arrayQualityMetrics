0.) scanDates handling for next release
---------------------------------------
In aqm.prepdata help:
protocolData(CCl4)$scanDates = rep("2006/07/19", ncol(CCl4)) # to add soon

1.) Duplicate correlation
-------------------------
If featureData contains a factor that identifies features containing 
the same reporter sequence, we can check for that (scatterplots, 
standard deviation)

2.) Outlier detection
---------------------
Use outliers package and mvoutlier package as alternatives to boxplot.stats. See flowQ as a model.


* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its dependence on draw.key). It would be better if it did not do that. 
=> AK: Fixed by adding a "dev.off()" but maybe there is a better way?
=> WH: I removed that again, it seemed too fragile. Also, in such cases,
   please use the same "if" condition than what was used in the complement;
   i.e., here not "if (!(missing(intgroup)||is.na(intgroup)))" but 
   "if(!is.null(cl$key))"

* generates pdf files for density and PCA plots
=> Done, the pdf files are created but the link in the html does not work on the svg image.

* replace rect/square by auto-determined image size. Check if that solves the problem of names on heatmap that are unreadable when > 50 arrays

* Somewhere, empty lists are printed: -  clean this up.

* maplot.pdf and spatial.pdf are enormous, do we really need that? 
  WH: I put raster=TRUE experimentally into maplot.r to fix that (for maplot), but when I tried it crashed my R.
     It works for me in other contexts (and reduces PDF file sizes for such plots enormously!) ,
     perhaps here it is a particular problem with panel.smoothScatter.
     Maybe the best is to send Paul Murell a reproducible bug report, wait until this functionality 
     is more stable, and then use it.

* In aqm.rle and aqm.nuse, the ylims are hard-coded (c(-1, 1) and c(0.95, 1.5)) and often seem 
  too large - is there a good reason for that, or should we try to compute them dynamically depending 
  on the range of the data?

* The role of the 'sN' parameter is unclear, e.g. in the man page (what happens if not null?). 
  It is also handled differently (or indeed ignored) in the different qm-functions. 
  My suggestion would be to simply drop (deprecate) it; or replace it by a 
  character, whose default is the current behaviour (a table at the top) and alternative behaviours are 
  currently not implemented. 
  If people really want to specify their own sample names, then they can simply stick them into the 
  sampleNames slot of the 'expressionset'. That way, it will be unambiguous in the code where the sample names
  to be used are to be found. The current situation is ambiguous (e.g. sN is passed to aqm.rnadeg, but not
  to density) and clumsy  (lugging around an extra argument through all the function calls)

* Fix the man pages for aqmobj.rnadeg etc. to reflect recent changes (to ease maintenance, 
  pages for similar classes could be collected into one file, like in aqm.boxplot.Rd)

* The handling of exception is currently inconsistent. For instance, in aqm.rnadeg you have
    rnaDeg = try(AffyRNAdeg(expressionset, log.it = TRUE))
    if(class(rnaDeg)=='try-error')
      warning("RNA digestion plot from the package 'affy' cannot be produced for this data set.")
  but then the function continues as if nothing had happened, and an error is thrown later by the method 
  "aqm.plot" with signature "aqmobj.rnadeg". Either build in error robustness throughout (e.g. 
  by letting aqm.rnadeg return with the exception object, and then let aqm.plot be robust against that;
  or, just throw the error and stop.
