0.) scanDates handling for next release
---------------------------------------
In aqm.prepdata help:
protocolData(CCl4)$scanDates = rep("2006/07/19", ncol(CCl4)) # to add soon


1.) Duplicate correlation
-------------------------
If featureData contains a factor that identifies features containing 
the same reporter sequence, we can check for that (scatterplots, 
standard deviation)

2.) Outlier detection
---------------------
Use outliers package and mvoutlier package as alternatives to boxplot.stats. See flowQ as a model.
