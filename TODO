* work with new beadarray data objects; including the spatial plot.

* vignette should advise to reduce the size of 'pData', if it is large, before calling arrayQualityMetrics

* check density estimation / bandwidth for nCCl4 - should not be wiggly.

* check the robustness of the behaviour if 'svg' device is missing.

* meanSdPlot should use 'smoothScatter' (this is something that should
  be done in the vsn package) instead of drawing individual dots.

* smoothScatter in MA-plot sometimes gives warnings / fails with an error message about grid size. Fix that.




* for AffyBatch, the spatial plots could show the affyPLM residuals instead 
  of the intensities themselves. However, currently, I don't seem to be able to access
  the image method from affyPLM, and it looks messy. 

* duplicate correlation: If featureData contains a factor that
  identifies features containing the same reporter sequence, we can
  check for that (scatterplots, standard deviation)
