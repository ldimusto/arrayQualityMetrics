1.) Duplicate correlation
-------------------------
If featureData contains a factor that identifies features containing 
the same reporter sequence, we can check for that (scatterplots, 
standard deviation)

2.) Outlier detection
---------------------
Use outliers package and mvoutlier package as alternatives to boxplot.stats. See flowQ as a model.
outliers: chisq.out.test - reject extreme outliers, if no known variance is specified.
outliers: dixon.test
outliers: grubbs.test - small sample?
