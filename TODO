* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its
  dependence on draw.key). Avoid that.

* Remove printing of empty lists onto console when the MA plots are written
  into the pdf file. 

* When heatmap gets large (e.g. >50 arrays), array names tend not to be very 
  readable.

* Duplicate correlation: If featureData contains a factor that
  identifies features containing the same reporter sequence, we can
  check for that (scatterplots, standard deviation)

* affyspecific.r: 
  - Fix the outlier computation (see 'TODO')
  - Use 'colSums' - it's faster  (see 'TODO')

* arrayQualityMetrics.R:
  - move spatial computations into function 'aqm.spatial'  (see 'TODO')

* writereport.r:
  - do we need (Sys.info()["sysname"] == "Darwin") here?  (see 'TODO')
  Use style sheet rather than hard-coding font descriptions all over the place into the code.


* maplot.r:
  clumsy outlier computation
