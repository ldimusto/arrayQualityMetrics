* The arrays marked as outliers should by default be already highlighted in
  the density plots.

* Remove tooltips from heatmap, it scales badly with heatmap size, and is not 
  really needed.

* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its
  dependence on draw.key). Avoid that.

* Remove printing of empty lists onto console when the MA plots are written
  into the pdf file. 

* Everywhere replace rect/square by auto-determined image size.  Check
  if that solves the problem of names on heatmap that are unreadable
  when > 50 arrays.  When heatmap gets too large (say, more than 80
  arrays, don't include the SVG file into the plot, but rather just
  provide a link to it so that people can open it separately.)  
  => AK:
  PARTIALLY DONE. I am not satisfied with the output. Even with
  increasing image size, not very readable when > 50 arrays.

* Duplicate correlation: If featureData contains a factor that
  identifies features containing the same reporter sequence, we can
  check for that (scatterplots, standard deviation)
