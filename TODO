* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its
  dependence on draw.key). Avoid that.

* Remove printing of empty lists onto console when the MA plots are written
  into the pdf file. 

* When heatmap gets large (e.g. >50 arrays), array names tend not to be very 
  readable.

* Duplicate correlation: If featureData contains a factor that
  identifies features containing the same reporter sequence, we can
  check for that (scatterplots, standard deviation)
