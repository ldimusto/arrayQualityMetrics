0.) scanDates handling for next release
---------------------------------------
In aqm.prepdata help:
protocolData(CCl4)$scanDates = rep("2006/07/19", ncol(CCl4)) # to add soon

1.) Duplicate correlation
-------------------------
If featureData contains a factor that identifies features containing 
the same reporter sequence, we can check for that (scatterplots, 
standard deviation)

2.) Outlier detection
---------------------
Use outliers package and mvoutlier package as alternatives to boxplot.stats. See flowQ as a model.


* The function 'aqm.boxplot' opens a graphics device (through its dependence on draw.key). It would be better if it did not do that. 
=> Fixed by adding a "dev.off()" but maybe there is a better way?

* With the following, why are only two arrays shown?
arrayQualityMetrics(subset10, "QA10", force = TRUE, do.logtransform = TRUE,
                    intgroup = "FactorValue..ER.status.")
=> Cannot reproduce that error

* generates pdf files for density and PCA plots
=> Done, the pdf files are created but the link in the html does not work on the svg image.

* replace rect/square by auto-determined image size. Check if that solves the problem of names on heatmap that are unreadable when > 50 arrays

* Somewhere, empty lists are printed: -  clean this up.

* maplot.pdf is enormous, do we really need that? (I put raster=TRUE experimentally into maplot.r to fix that)
